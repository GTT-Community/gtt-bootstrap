# GTT - artifact identity + technical index (rebuild).
#
# Registers new artifacts in gtt/index/artifacts.json and regenerates
# gtt/index/technical-index.json. The index is DERIVED from the Markdown -
# never hand-edit it, never treat it as authority; delete and rebuild at
# will. Refuses to run while a registered path is missing (an unreconciled
# move) - run gtt-reconcile.sh first.
#
# Usage:
#   gtt/scripts/gtt-index.sh
#
# Exit 0 = ok, 1 = violation / unresolved, 2 = cannot run.
