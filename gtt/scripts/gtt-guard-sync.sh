# GTT - GTTGuard registry sync.
#
# Regenerates gtt/protection/registry.yaml from the @GTTGuard markers found
# in source. The registry is a derived artifact, like a lockfile - never
# hand-edit it; edit the marker in source and re-run this script instead.
# gtt/scripts/gtt-check-protection.sh fails the build if the committed
# registry has drifted from what this script would produce.
#
# Usage:
#   gtt/scripts/gtt-guard-sync.sh
#
# Exit 0 = synced, 1 = a marker could not be resolved, 2 = cannot run.
