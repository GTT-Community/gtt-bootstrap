# GTT - move/rename reconciliation.
#
# Detects artifacts whose path changed (git rename hints, same identity, or
# content similarity), then - with --apply - updates identity (old path kept
# as history) and rewrites relative links. Dry-run by default. Frozen
# governed files are never rewritten; they are reported instead.
#
# Usage:
#   gtt/scripts/gtt-reconcile.sh [--apply] [--map OLD=NEW] [--retire ID]
#
# Exit 0 = ok, 1 = violation / unresolved, 2 = cannot run.

# `command -v python3` alone is not reliable on Windows: a stub python3.exe

# Store redirect and exiting non-zero. Probe each candidate with a real
# no-op invocation instead of trusting PATH presence.
