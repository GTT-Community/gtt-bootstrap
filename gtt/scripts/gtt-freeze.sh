gtt-freeze: FAILED

Freezing is a ratification, not a file move. Context that is still template
text would be ratified as if it were a decision. Fill in the files above, or
run the gtt-bootstrap skill, then try again.

gtt-freeze: DONE

gtt/context/ and gtt/adr/ are now read-only for agents. From here, changes
go through gtt/CHANGE-REQUEST.md -> gtt/proposals/ -> you apply.

Commit gtt/.frozen. It is versioned on purpose: a clone of a frozen project
stays frozen.
