# GTT - GTTGuard protection registry gate.
#
# Deterministic validation of gtt/protection/registry.yaml (see the GTT
# Method canonical spec v2.1, sections 13-17 "GTTGuard"): the registry must match a
# fresh regeneration from source markers, every artifact/symbol must
# resolve, every protection value must be valid, every ADR-shaped `source`
# must exist, and a protected artifact that changed in the diff must be
# accompanied by a change under gtt/proposals/ or gtt/adr/.
#
# Usage:
#   gtt/scripts/gtt-check-protection.sh              # compare against origin/main
#   gtt/scripts/gtt-check-protection.sh <base-ref>   # compare against another ref
#
# Exit 0 = pass, 1 = violation, 2 = cannot determine.
