# GTT - Session Memory adapter conformance gate.
#
# Checks one ADE adapter against gtt/docs/SESSION-ADAPTER-CONTRACT.md using
# its declaration gtt/session-adapters/<ade>.json: files present, registered
# under the declared event only, references the service, no duplicated GTT
# logic, no silenced errors, the command runs in a sandbox laid out as
# installed, every non-authority marker reaches the agent, and the failure
# path is visible. Deterministic; needs no ADE installed. Each item is PASS,
# FAIL, or SKIPPED - runtime verification by the real ADE is always SKIPPED
# here and reported as declared, never as PASS.
#
# Usage:
#   gtt/scripts/gtt-check-session-adapter.sh <ade>     # a name from gtt/session-adapters/
#
# Exit 0 = no FAIL, 1 = violation, 2 = cannot run.
