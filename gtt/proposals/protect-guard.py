"""GTT - GTTGuard protected-artifact enforcement (PreToolUse hook).

Sibling to protect-l0.py, but for a different layer: protect-l0.py guards
gtt/context/, gtt/adr/, and the two governance root files; this hook guards
whatever L3 code a developer has opted into protecting with a @GTTGuard
marker (GTT Method canonical spec v2.1, sections 13-17 "GTTGuard"), recorded in
gtt/protection/registry.yaml by gtt/scripts/gtt-guard-sync.sh.

Granularity: a file-scope entry (empty symbol) blocks the whole file, same
as protect-l0.py. A class/method-scope entry resolves that symbol's current
line span live from disk (via gtt_guard.resolve_symbol_span - never cached,
so it can never go stale) and blocks any Edit whose old_string OVERLAPS
that span - by line range, not text containment, so an edit that merely
starts or ends inside the boundary (e.g. a reformat that also touches the
next line) is still caught - while an unprotected sibling method in the
same file stays freely editable, matching the proposal's own worked
example. Any ambiguity - the symbol can't be resolved, or the tool is
Write/NotebookEdit (which replace the whole file) - fails SAFE to blocking
the entire file rather than risking a silent bypass.

Bash is blocked outright for any mutating-looking command that names a
protected file, for the same reason protect-l0.py takes the same stance for
machinery: there is no way to inspect a shell command's line-range effect
on a file, so no attempt is made to be more precise than that.

Exit 2 plus permissionDecision:deny blocks the call deterministically. Any
unexpected input, or an empty/missing registry, exits 0 so a broken hook or
an ungoverned project never blocks a session.
