# Kiro CLI adapter for the GTT Session Memory Service (STAGED - Draft, not a decision).
#
# No GTT logic here. It runs the ADE-independent service and prints its
# stdout. Kiro's trigger reference says agentSpawn stdout is added to the
# agent's context on exit 0; the agent-configuration reference is silent on
# that, so this is DOCUMENTED IN ONE PLACE, NOT RUNTIME VERIFIED (Kiro is not
# installed where this was prepared). Coverage N1, Kiro CLI only.
#
# A failure is reported on stderr with exit 1 (never 2), no partial context.
# Assumes the Kiro session working directory is the project root.
