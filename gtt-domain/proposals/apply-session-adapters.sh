# GTT - PROMOTION SCRIPT (human execution required)
#
# Status: Draft - not a decision. Prepared by an agent; never run by one.
# Running it does NOT ratify anything: adopting an ADE adapter changes the
# adapter matrix (AGENTS.md, gtt-check-adapter.sh, the gtt-bootstrap skill) and
# needs Proposal -> Epic/Story -> ADR -> human ratification. This only copies
# staged files to the ADE's native paths and flips the declaration to
# "installed" so you can try them.
#
# Installs the staged Session Memory adapters you name:
#   codex    -> .codex/hooks.json, .codex/gtt-session-start.sh
#   copilot  -> .github/hooks/gtt-session.json, .github/hooks/gtt-session-start.py
#   kiro     -> .kiro/agents/gtt-session.json, .kiro/gtt-session-start.sh
# It refuses to overwrite an existing file. On any failure it removes what it
# copied and restores the declarations.
#
# Usage (from the project root):
#   bash gtt-domain/proposals/apply-session-adapters.sh <codex|copilot|kiro>...
