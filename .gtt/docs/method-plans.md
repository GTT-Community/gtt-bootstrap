# GTT Bootstrap — Method Plans

> **Canonical reference:** https://github.com/GTT-Community/gtt-method/blob/main/GTT-CANONICAL-v2.1.md

A **Method Plan** answers one question: *how much of the operational work do you
delegate to GTT?* You choose an intention — Light, Medium, Hard or Team — and GTT
derives the technical policies from it. You are never asked to configure an index
policy, an identity policy or a validation policy one by one.

This page is the human-readable rendering of `.gtt/contract/profiles.json`. That
file is the single definition; if the two ever disagree, the contract is right and
the disagreement is a defect to report.

## What a plan is, and what it is not

- A plan is an **operating and collaboration profile**. It sets how often GTT stops
  to ask you, and what a team must have in place.
- A plan is **not a quality level**. Light is not "worse" and Hard is not "better":
  they fit different situations.
- A plan **never turns governance off**. The rules in the next section hold in all
  four.
- A plan is **not the THINK Depth**. The Design Assessment has its own levels —
  `QUICK`, `STANDARD` and `DEEP` — for how deep the design is assessed and explored
  during bootstrap. The depth is chosen separately, is never derived from the plan,
  and changes no gate. See *Assessing and strengthening an existing design* in
  `readme-gtt.md`.

## What no plan changes

These hold in every plan. No selection, ADE or automation level weakens them, and
the contract check fails if a plan tries.

| Rule | What it means for you |
|---|---|
| Human decision authority | Agents prepare; only a human decides, ratifies and freezes. |
| Governed decisions are always confirmed | A change to `gtt-domain/context/`, `gtt-domain/adr/`, an Epic's goal or scope, a GTTGuard-protected artifact or the freeze always needs your explicit decision. |
| Ordinary work is never confirmed | Implementation, refactors, tests, commits and Stories need no approval, in any plan. A Story is the working plan, not a gate. |
| Only BLOCKING stops work | GTT observes the work against the frozen design. An observation that is not `BLOCKING` never stops it; a block always names the rule you ratified. |
| Destructive operations are always confirmed | Nothing that cannot be regenerated is removed or overwritten without asking. |
| Proposals are never decisions | A `[PROPUESTA]` never appears inside governed context. |
| Conflicts stay visible | A conflict between sources is exposed, never silently resolved. |
| Freeze is a ratification | It freezes the design, never the code. There is no unfreeze shortcut; frozen context changes only through the governed path, completed by a new freeze. |
| Protected artifacts | GTTGuard-protected code and frozen context are never modified autonomously. |

## Vocabulary

The plans are described with four terms. Each has one meaning:

| Term | Meaning | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Deterministic operation | The result follows entirely from the repository and the declared policy; no judgment is involved. | Allocating the next free id, rebuilding the index, regenerating the GTTGuard registry, running validation |
| Relevant change | An automated operation that rewrites files people or ADEs read, rather than derived ones. | Updating references across documents after a move, synchronising ADE context files |
| Destructive operation | Removes or overwrites something that cannot be regenerated. | `clean`, removing an ADE, overwriting a file |
| Governed decision | Changes L0/L1, the structure of the backlog, a protected artifact or the freeze. | Changing the stack, accepting an ADR, freezing |

## Choosing a plan

The Bootstrap asks. It does not choose for you, and it does not infer a plan from
the project, the ADE or a previous project.

```text
Select GTT Method Plan

[1] Light Method
    Maximum safe automation and the fewest interruptions, for one developer or a governed prototype.

[2] Medium Method
    Automation with confirmation of relevant changes, for an individual project or a small team.

[3] Hard Method
    Explicit human authorization of every governed operation, for production and critical systems.

[4] Team Method
    Collaborative governance: the Hard gates plus CI, actor traceability and shared team policy.
```

The one-line descriptions are the `summary` of each plan in the contract, shown as
written.

Until you choose, the project reports its plan as **not selected**. Validation still
runs, using the Medium gates as a fallback — the behaviour GTT had before plans
existed. That fallback is not a selection: the status says `not selected` in plain
words, and the Bootstrap still has to ask.

## The four plans

### Light Method

**For:** an individual developer, a personal project, a governed prototype, a POC or
a spike — wherever the lowest operational load is wanted.

**GTT does without asking:** allocates ids, updates references, rebuilds the index,
validates, and synchronises ADE context when nothing you wrote would be overwritten.

**You are asked for:** governed decisions and destructive operations. Nothing else.

**What Light relaxes — stated exactly, because it is the only plan that relaxes
anything:**

| Control | In Light |
|---|---|
| Documentation depth | `solution-vision`, `stack` and `constraints` must be real before freeze; `architecture`, `principles` and `glossary` may stay minimal, but must not contain template placeholders. |
| ADR expectations | An ADR is expected only for a change that alters frozen governed context. |
| The two confirmations | Confirmation A (source) and Confirmation B (context) may be asked in one exchange; each still needs its own explicit answer. |
| Audit cadence | `gtt-audit` is not scheduled; run it on demand. |

**Machine-enforced gates:** provenance advisory; warnings do not block freeze.

### Medium Method

**For:** normal development — features, integrations, internal services — by an
individual or a small team that wants automation but prefers to confirm relevant
changes.

**GTT does without asking:** allocates ids, rebuilds the index, validates.

**You are asked for:** relevant changes (reference updates, ADE context
synchronisation), governed decisions and destructive operations.

**Requires:** all six governed context files real before freeze; an ADR for every
architectural decision that changes governed context; `gtt-audit` before a release
or after a large merge. CI is recommended.

**Machine-enforced gates:** provenance advisory; warnings do not block freeze.

### Hard Method

**For:** production, critical or security-sensitive systems, high-consequence
architecture, regulated work.

Hard does not mean manual work. It means **explicit control over governed
operations**: GTT still prepares everything; it waits for you before applying.

**GTT does without asking:** rebuilds the index and validates — derived state only.

**You are asked for:** ids (GTT proposes one, you confirm), relevant changes,
governed decisions and destructive operations.

**Requires:** all six context files real, every technology row cited, a source
manifest; an ADR for every change to governed context, including small ones;
rollback and blast radius in every proposal; `gtt-audit` before every promotion.
CI is recommended.

**Machine-enforced gates:** provenance required; a source manifest required for
freeze; every OPEN gap must carry `affects`; warnings block freeze.

### Team Method

**For:** teams and collaborative projects — several people, or several ADEs,
changing the same governed project.

**GTT does without asking:** rebuilds the index and validates. For ids, reference
updates and ADE synchronisation it follows what the team declares in
`gtt-domain/working-agreements.md`; where the team has declared nothing, GTT
proposes and waits for confirmation, as in Hard.

**You are asked for:** governed decisions and destructive operations, always; the
rest as the team's policy says.

**Requires:** everything Hard requires, plus: validation running in CI on every
change; a second person reviewing each proposal and promotion script; the acting
person recorded for confirmations, ADRs and evidence; the base revision checked at
promotion so a concurrent change is detected rather than overwritten.

**Machine-enforced gates:** the same as Hard.

> **Status: baseline.** Today Team is the Hard gates plus the collaboration
> requirements above. Dedicated team plans are planned and will refine this
> definition. Until they ship, nothing beyond what is written here is promised.

## Side by side

| | Light | Medium | Hard | Team |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GTT structure | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| Invariants | all | all | all | all |
| Relaxed controls | four, listed above | none | none | none |
| Automation | high | medium-high | controlled | high, by team policy |
| Id resolution | automatic | automatic | proposed, then confirmed | team policy |
| Reference updates | automatic | confirmed | confirmed | team policy |
| ADE context sync | automatic when safe | confirmed | confirmed | team policy |
| Index and validation | automatic | automatic | automatic | automatic |
| Governed decisions | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed |
| Destructive operations | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed | confirmed |
| CI | optional | recommended | recommended | required |
| Multi-user | optional | optional | possible | central |
| Traceability | standard | standard | standard | reinforced (actor recorded) |
| Provenance gate | advisory | advisory | required | required |
| Warnings block freeze | no | no | yes | yes |

## What is enforced, and by what

A plan is honest about where each of its rules is enforced:

| Part of the plan | Enforced by | Verified by the Bootstrap? |
|---|---|---|
| Gates (provenance, source manifest, `affects`, warnings) | `gtt-check-provenance.sh`, in `gtt-validate.sh` and `gtt-freeze.sh` | Yes — deterministic |
| Observation gate (`governance_observation_fails_check`) | `gtt-observe.sh check`, in `gtt-validate.sh`: under Hard and Team an undecided `GOVERNANCE` observation fails the check; under Light and Medium only `BLOCKING` and rejected observations do | Yes — deterministic |
| Invariants | Hooks, scripts and gates, as each one states in the contract | Yes, where a gate or hook exists |
| Semantics (proposal rigor, documentation depth, ADR and audit expectations) | Instructions to agents (`AGENTS.md`, the bootstrap skill) | No — nothing verifies that an ADE follows them |
| Operating policy (what is automatic, what is confirmed, CI, actor traceability) | The GTT CLI, which reads it from the contract | No — the Bootstrap declares it; the CLI executes it |

The Bootstrap and the CLI do not implement the same rule twice: the Bootstrap
defines what a plan means, the CLI reads that definition and acts on it.

## How GTT avoids interrupting you

> The developer decides what only the developer can decide. GTT does everything else.

The rule is one; **its effect depends on your plan**. The plan sets *which* operations
GTT does without asking; the rule sets *how* GTT behaves around them. Lower friction never means less
governance: no confirmation, gate or invariant above is weakened by it.

**Before asking you anything**, GTT checks whether the answer already follows from
the governed context, your plan, the project's policies, the actual state of the
project, or a deterministic rule. If it does, GTT acts, validates the result and
continues. If it does not, it names the decision, explains it briefly and asks once.

**In no plan are you asked** whether to rebuild the index, validate, or continue to
the next planned step. The rest depends on the plan:

| | Light | Medium | Hard | Team |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| An id is taken | next free one, used | next free one, used | next free one, **proposed** | next free one, **proposed** unless team policy says otherwise |
| An artifact was moved | references rewritten, reported | **stops**, gives the command | **stops**, gives the command | **stops**, gives the command unless team policy says otherwise |
| ADE context needs syncing | done when safe | **confirmed** | **confirmed** | team policy |
| You are asked for | governed decisions, destructive operations | + relevant changes | + ids, relevant changes | + what the team policy reserves |

`bash .gtt/scripts/gtt-project.sh interaction` prints this for the selected plan, derived
from its policy — the same data the CLI receives.

| Situation | What GTT does |
|---|---|
| The id you asked for is taken | Finds the next free one (`gtt-project.sh next-id --kind adr`); a retired id is never reused. Light and Medium use it; in Hard and Team it is proposed, and you confirm it when you review the package — not in a separate question. |
| Any operation finished | Runs `gtt-maintain.sh`: protection registry, index and validation in one run, reported in a few lines. |
| A moved or renamed artifact | Rewriting references is a relevant change. In Light `gtt-maintain.sh` reconciles the unambiguous moves and reports them; in Medium, Hard and Team — or with no plan selected — it stops and gives the exact `gtt-reconcile.sh` command. An ambiguous move or a missing artifact is a decision in every plan. |
| A governed or protected change | Hands you **one executable script** with the whole operation, its precondition checks and an explicit failure when the state is not the expected one. You run it; GTT never does. Then GTT validates and continues. |

**GTT stops only for** a genuine architectural or semantic conflict; a decision only
you can make; an authorization a protected or governed operation requires; a safety
or integrity condition that prevents continuing; or missing evidence it needs to
continue correctly. Reaching an intermediate mechanical step is not a reason to stop.

**GTT says when it is GTT speaking.** Every message the method raises in your ADE — a
question, a confirmation or choice, the Initial Design Questionnaire, a proposal, a
finding, a request for authorization, a report — opens with `@gtt · <what it is>`:
`@gtt · Method Plan`, `@gtt · Initial Design Questionnaire`, `@gtt · Authorization
required`. The assistant's ordinary conversation carries no marker, so you can always
tell the method from the assistant. The marker says who is speaking; it is never a
decision or an approval.

**Reports are brief by default** — what was done, the result, whether you must act,
and the next step:

```text
@gtt · Report
✓ Protection registry in sync.
✓ Index rebuilt (51 artifact(s), 513 section(s)).
✓ Validation: 11 passed, 1 skipped.
```

Detail is never withheld, only not volunteered: `gtt-maintain.sh --verbose`,
`gtt-status.sh`, `gtt-query.sh`, or the full output of any check.

Where this is enforced: the two services above are deterministic scripts. The
behaviour around them — not asking, stopping only for the reasons listed, reporting
briefly — is an instruction to agents and a policy the CLI executes; the Bootstrap
declares it (`profiles.json` → `developer_experience`) and cannot verify that an ADE
follows it.

## Selecting and changing a plan

A plan can be selected or changed at any time without recreating the project. Only
`.gtt/methodology.json` is written; governed context, ADRs, proposals, backlog,
index and history are untouched.

```bash
bash .gtt/scripts/gtt-project.sh profile get                          # what is selected
bash .gtt/scripts/gtt-project.sh profile set --profile light          # dry run: shows the change
bash .gtt/scripts/gtt-project.sh profile set --profile light --apply  # writes it
```

A CLI does the same through the declared operations `methodology.profile.get` and
`methodology.profile.set`. The operations keep the name *profile* for compatibility
with the 1.0 contract; *profile* and *plan* are the same thing.

**In a frozen project**, moving to a *less* strict plan is refused: it is a governed
change and follows the normal path (change request → proposal → human decision).
Moving to a stricter one is allowed. The order is Light < Medium < Hard < Team.

## What the Bootstrap deliberately does not add

- **No second configuration file.** The selection lives in `.gtt/methodology.json`
  and the meaning in `.gtt/contract/profiles.json`. There is no `.gtt/config.yaml`.
- **No separate agent registry.** Which ADEs take part is already recorded in
  `.gtt/ade.json` and declared in `.gtt/scaffold/manifest.yaml`; an ADE never joins
  merely because it is installed on the machine.
